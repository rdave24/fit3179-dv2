                <b>Formula One </b>is the highest class for open seater racing cars sanctioned by the 
                Fêdêration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The sport first started in 1950,
                and currently has 10 teams, and 20 drivers every year. The following visulation will
                cover the data from the kaggle set about the history of F1.

                    The map visulation shows the location of all the tracks that Forumula One 
                    has races in from 1950 onwards. While F1 claims to be an internation sport
                    trying to reach most of the world, it is clear that the sport is still 
                    Europe dominant. While the data is skewed due to the fact that the sport in
                    its early years would race mainly in Europe and as of more recent year there
                    have been more races in the other continents, in the latest season 9 out of 
                    the 23 races were still in Europe.

                <div class="grid-item-tracks-graph-text"> 
                    Looking at a zoomed in map of europe, we can even see that the sport is more 
                    concentrated in the western part of Europe. This is due to the fact that the
                    sport originated in Europe and the teams are based in Europe. This is further
                    supported by the tracks that have been on the F1 calander for the longest time
                    have mostly all been in Europe.

                <div class="grid-item-tracks-map-text"> 
                    If we look at the track data, for the fastest lap times, we can see that the 
                    most times actually increased from 2004 to 2013, with then the track times 
                    then reducing. The drop in track times in 2014 can be attributed to the major 
                    engine rule changes that were introduced in 2014. Another effect of the rules
                    can be seen 2018, where all the tracks had a quicker time, this was due to 
                    another change in wings which aimed to increase to top speed of the cars. While
                    you would expect engineering and team development to lead to faster times, the
                    rules and regulations of the sport have a major impact on the track times.

                        We can see most of the drivers that have ever won a championship are majoirty
                        from Europe, with not a single winner from Asia. Michael Schumacher and Lewis
                        Hamilton currently hold the record for the most championships won with 7 each. 
                        This is more statitics that show that F1 is still a european dominated sport.

            <div id="drivers"></div>
            <div class="drivers-text">
                If we look at all drivers, we can see that as the seasons went on, there have been
                a decrease in the total number of drivers. This is in contract to there been less 
                races in earlier seasons, which you would think would lead to less drivers. This 
                however is not the case, and the reason for more drivers in earlier season is due 
                to F1 being a more organised sport as the years went on. In early years of the sport
                it was more of a with anyone allowed to drive thus leading to large number of drivers.
                Most of these drivers would of raced in a single race, comapred to the latest seasons, 
                where the drivers would be full time athelets that would be with the constructors for 
                an entire, if not multiple seasons.

            </div>
            <div class="drivers-text">
                Another trend we can see if, that in the early years there were a large number of American
                drivers, almost half of the drivers, with the other half being European drivers. From 1960's 
                we can see that the number of American drivers has decreased, with the number of European 
                being proportionally more.
